# EDA-File
analysis on team and players in NBA






## 📊 Key Objectives

- Understand the structure and summary statistics of the NBA dataset.
- Visualize distributions of key features such as height, weight, and age.
- Compare player attributes across different positions.
- Explore correlations between player features and performance indicators.
- Generate actionable insights that can support sports analytics use cases.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis environment

## 📌 Key Insights (from the EDA)

- Distribution of player heights and weights shows variability across positions.
- Guards tend to be lighter and shorter than centers and forwards.
- Age and experience can be linked to performance consistency in some cases.
- Certain physical attributes may impact a player's effectiveness at different positions.
